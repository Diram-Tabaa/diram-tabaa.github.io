On a mission to make robots percieve beyond what they see.

I am a **Research Associate** at Carnegie Mellon University Qatar on a QRDI funded project to develop a mobile robot solution to enable autonomous greenhouse monitoring. I work across numerous domains, including [photorealistic rendering, 3D deep learning, and robotic simulation](/publications). I have the great pleasure of working with Dr. [Gianni Di Caro](http://www.giannidicaro.com/), who also was my thesis advisor during my undergrad at CMU.

In addition to my research, I have a strong interest in computer systems design and implementation. I have previously  co-designed and implemented a UNIX-like kernel that supports preemptive scheduling and provides device drivers for console, keyboard, and timer hardware. 

Beyond Computers, I am passionate about Arabic calligraphy & Poetry. I am also an avid listener of [maqāmāt music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmZ3P0A6yPA)
